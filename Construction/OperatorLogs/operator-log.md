## 2026-03-25 — Foundation stood up

### Infrastructure
- Confirmed Docker already installed and active on `murray-vserver`
- Created `/opt/victory`
- Started dedicated Postgres container:
  - `victory-postgres`
- Chose Docker as deployment/install truth
- Chose host-Go + Docker-Postgres hybrid mode for faster development iteration

### Schema / Database
- Applied initial schema migration
- Established tables for:
  - users
  - locations
  - memberships
  - lots
  - venues
  - libraries
  - elements
  - placements
  - sessions
  - participants
  - actions
- Added `handle` to users
- Seeded one active live session for `the-cave`

### World Seeding
- Seeded location `amurray.family`
- Seeded lot `main-lot`
- Seeded venue `the-cave`
- Seeded library `house-library`
- Seeded reusable element `first-fire`
- Seeded default placement of `first-fire` into `the-cave`

### Backend
- Created first Go backend
- Added DB connection layer
- Added `/health`
- Added `/api/world/the-cave`
- Fixed timestamp scanning bug in snapshot loader
- Fixed empty actions serialization (`[]` instead of `null`)
- Added `POST /api/session/the-cave/join`
- Added websocket endpoint `/ws/the-cave`

### Identity
- Established current v1 identity model:
  - stable user id
  - handle
  - display name
- Verified join behavior:
  - create/update user by handle
  - join active session
  - default role currently audience

### WebSocket / Observation
- Verified websocket connection to `/ws/the-cave`
- Verified initial snapshot delivery
- Verified ping/pong behavior

### Reaction Loop
- Implemented `react/emote`
- Verified reaction validation
- Verified server-assigned `moment_id`
- Verified persistence to `actions`
- Verified broadcast to connected websocket clients
- Verified late joiner sees prior reaction in snapshot
- Verified live reaction delivery to later-connected observer

### Current Status
Kernel 1.2 remains PARTIAL.

Reason:
- observation path works
- reaction path works
- speech path not yet implemented
- full actor→audience→reaction proof not yet complete

### Current Confirmed Working Stack
- world snapshot
- persistent join
- websocket observer stream
- recorded reaction broadcast

### Current Known Frictions
- Docker rebuilds are slow for active coding
- host-Go development requires correct localhost DB configuration
- install workflow and dev workflow are not yet formalized into scripts/docs

### Recommended Next Step
Implement `perform/speak` using the same action pipeline:
- validate joined actor
- assign `moment_id`
- persist action
- broadcast to observers
